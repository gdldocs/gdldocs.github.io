# EXTRAS

This is a personal space for sharing technical documentation with the whole wide world.

This is a one-woman-project and I might not be following good or common practises here.
Since I will probably be the only person maintaining this, changes might not be on a fixed schedule.  I do this in my spare time, whenever is it possible.

Docs might be in English or Spanish depending on my needs. Ideally I will have them translated in both languages. 

If anyone wants to expand and translate to other languages, feel free to fork the project and send a merge-request.

This is a work in progress. I am tidying things around still (March 3rd, 2024)

## CHANGELOG

```
2024-03-03: sass corrections & persistent dark layout

Changed the colour for links to green in order to have a better contrast with the dark-grey background
Now 'dark-mode' is mandatory. Light background is not available anymore.

```
