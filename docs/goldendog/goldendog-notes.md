## About GoldenDog Linux

GoldenDog Linux is a stable distro aimed at desktops but it could very well be used as a server
it is a debian stable respin, so, under the hood it's a debian stable release. No need to exlain further
what this means in terms of security and stability.


Features:

- KDE Plasma
- Konversation (IRC Client)
- git
- Github CLI
- Kdenlive (Video Editor)
- Audacity (Audio Editor)
- LibreOffice

... And many more coming soon.


## History

A long time ago I was a big fan of YellowDog Linux for the PPC Architecture. This project was built on a RHEL platform.
I decided to bring it back to life, but for the AMD64 Architectures. It was too troublesome to achieve.

Then I decided to use debian as its platform since its stable release meant the distro would be secure. 

In order to avoid copyright problems, I decided to call it GoldenDog instead of YellowDog. It's similar and it's also
in the memory of pawpaw, my golden retriever dog who is no longer with us in this world. 


## Releases

They will all be dog breeds, except for the first release, which is just called Puppy and it's mostly for testing.


The releases and point releases will likely follow those of debian. 

For example: Puppy 1.5 is debian 12.5 stable

Golden Retriever will be released when debian 13 is released, and will be 2.0, 2.5 and so on, depending on the point releases of Debian.


## This is a one-woman project and I will develop this as time allows it. 

Fortunately, choosing debian as platform makes it a lot easier for me. 


## Repositories

GoldenDog will only ship with debian repositories by default. Additional software will be optional and installed via git. 

The idea is that the system works and behaves exactly like a debian 12. 

Why not use debian 12 instead? There's really no difference, to be honest. 

The purpsoe is not to release anything better or greater than debian, but to have a little fun and learn new things.
